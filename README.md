# Educational Technology Plan

## Synopsis

In this educational technology plan I describe the hardware and software that I will use to teach HTML, CSS, and Javascript to a 9th-grade Advisory class in the upcoming semester. I describe specific ways I will incorporate educational technologies and evidence-based pedagogy in day-to-day lessons in order to help with student learning. I also describe specific strategies for establishing an inclusive computing classroom in order to spark interest and broaden participation in computer science. By the end of the semester, I expect my students to be able to collaborate on and create a web page that reflects their interests, demonstrates skills that they can use across disciplines, and perhaps even serve humanity. 

## Context

### Course

#### Advisory 

This course is a daily, 30-minute period during which documents (mainly progress reports) are distributed, announcements are made, and students are given the opportunity to study. There are typically three lessons given per week covering topics that include school culture, school policies, college, current events, history, and personal care. Students earn a grade for the course based on weekly deliverables, most of which, are related to one of these lessons. 

### Situation

My goal is to incorporate computer science into the Advisory course by giving one computer science lesson per week. While the objectives of some of these lessons will be aligned with computer science standards and cover topics such as data types and control structures, the overall objective is for students to produce a web page that students can publish, for free, on GitHub that can respond to user input. As such, the focus of the lessons will be HTML, CSS, and Javascript. What will my students build? Perhaps a GPA calculator or a web page that determines if the user is on track to graduate high school. 

All of the students in my school are given a Chromebook to take home and bring to class. Students have wireless internet access at school and can get a WIFI hotspot for home from the school if they don't have internet access at home. The school district's plan is to get enough computers so that each class has a set of computers that students can use at school and each student has a computer to keep at home. Students are required to use the Chromebook even if they have another computers. The use of Chromebooks means that student work and submission of student work will need to be done online, which GitHub and many cloud-based IDEs should accommodate.

The main constraint is time. With periods being only 30 minutes long, I expect to have no more than 17 hours per semester for lessons, problets, and labs. But even with limited time, the prospect of building something that they can share via a link may motivate some of my students to use their time efficiently in the class. Based on informal surveys in my classes, I serve a student population that had little exposure to computer science in school.

##### In-Class Internet Access

Teachers and students have wireless internet access in the classroom delivered by a Cisco Aironet 2702i controller-based wireless access point.

Results of a recent speed test were as follows:
- 40.2 Mbps download
- 9.98 Mbps upload
- Latency: 2ms

The in-class internet connection is fast and should be able to handle a class set of computers streaming video at the same time.

#### Projector and Speakers

I will be using a HD Canon projector in the classroom to project instruction/directions. Audio will be delievered via a set of Logitech speakers connected to my computer.

### Application

##### TechSmith Camtasia version 2019, Audacity, and Google Drive

For producing lessons on video, I plan on using Camtasia for screen capture and video editing. I plan on using Audacity for editing audio. I already have these software applications installed on my computer and have used them in the past to produce instructional videos.

Lesson videos will be uploaded onto Google Drive, which the school district has adopted and all students have access to using their school Google accounts.

Lessons will be produced with the multimedia principles in mind such as as the coherence principle, pre-training principle, and the segmentation principle. I will be the one narrating in the videos to provide both the visual and auditory elements (per the Dual-Coding Theory and voice principle). 

I plan on recording my screen, with narration, as I type HTML, CSS, and/or Javascript in Tryit Editor (or equivalent). These videos will be short with very specific objectives.

##### Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides, and Nearpod

For producing lesson slides, I plan on using Microsoft PowerPoint, which has a feature that allows the user to write directly on the slide and replay the writing at a constant, more reader-friendly pace. When I use this feature, I will convert the slides into a video, then add audio. This feature will help me to apply the signaling principle and spatial contiguity principle in my videos.

When I want to share the lesson slides with students, I will be using Google Slides. The school district has adopted the Google suite of cloud-based applications such as Docs, Sheets, and Slides.

When appropriate, I will be uploading the presentation on to Nearpod, which allows the addition of activities that I can use as checks for understanding. All of my students have access to Nearopd using their school Google accounts and have experience using it after a year of distance learning.  

Lesson videos will be embedded in the presentation to keep all relevant content accessible via one link.

Also, for videos that I've recorded 

#### Google Classroom and PowerSchool Teacher

I will be assigning lessons on Google classroom. I will also provide feedback, such as scores on submitted work, on Google classroom. Students may also comment on each others' web pages on Google classroom if I post each student's webpage link as a separate Google classroom material post. 

I use PowerSchool Teacher for keeping grade and attendance records. Students and their guardians already have access to PowerSchool.

#### GitHub Education

I will be sharing a template for the final deliverable on GitHub classroom. I will sync my GitHub classroom to my Google classroom. I will keep track of my students' progress by checking their published webpaged on GitHub. 

#### Tryit Editor v3.7 (or equivalent)

The editor is free and can be accessed via this link: https://www.w3schools.com/html/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_default_default.

Each lesson will include at least one problet projected in the classroom, but also viewable on the Nearpod lesson. Students can use the Tryit Editor (or equivalent) to instantly  check the results of their HTML, CSS, and/or Javascript response to the problet. Nearpod can be used to gather individual responses, which can then lead to small group and class discussions. Which can then lead to clarification per the peer instruction general practice. I will then give students time to add an element incorporating what they learned in the lesson to their final deliverable (semester project): their webpage published on GitHub. 

I plan on using Tryit Editor (or equivalent) for demonstrations in the classroom and in my lesson videos.

#### Google Chrome (or equivalent) browser

I will need a browser to access some of the online software referenced above.

#### Microsoft Windows 10 OS

I have some of the software referenced above installed on a PC running Microsoft Windows 10. These software choices were made based on the OS on my laptop.

### Impacts

#### How will the technology help *all* students learn?
All of the technology that I've listed above should be free to the students and accessible on their Chromebooks.

Most of the technology is cloud-based (that is, accessible online) and some technology (such as Nearpod) were adopted specifically for use during distance learning. Since all of the lessons and work will be delivered and submitted online, adapting to transitions back to distance learning (virtual education) should not be as challenging as was the case during the 2020-2021 academic year. Also, students have experience using all of the technology I've listed except for GitHub. 

My primary concern or challenge is the display size on the students' Chromebooks. I need to be mindful of this when producing videos and presentations that students will display on their 11.6" monitors.

I am hoping to address class resiliency by making the project a webpage that students can build and share online. I expect some students to learn new "tricks" on their own that they will incorporate into their web pages and share with their classmates. Since the lessons will be given during Advisory (not an actual computer science class), I want to make the project fun and open to student creativity. I want students to be motivated, not by the grade, but by learning a new way of expressing their creativity.
