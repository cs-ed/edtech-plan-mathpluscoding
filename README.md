# Educational Technology Plan

Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan

## Context

### Course

#### Advisory 

This course is a daily, 30-minute period during which documents (mainly progress reports) are distributed, announcements are made, and students are given the opportunity to study. There are typically three lessons given per week covering topics that include school culture, school policies, college, current events, history, and personal care. Students earn a grade for the course based on weekly deliverables, most of which, are related to one of these lessons. 

### Situation

My goal is to incorporate computer science into the Advisory course by giving one computer science lesson per week. While the objectives of some of these lessons will be aligned with computer science standards and cover topics such as data types and control structures, the overall objective is for students to produce a web page that students can publish, for free, on GitHub that can respond to user input. As such, the focus of the lessons will be HTML, CSS, and Javascript. What will my students build? Perhaps a GPA calculator or a web page that determines if the user is on track to graduate high school. 

All of the students in my school are given a Chromebook to take home and bring to class. Students have wireless internet access at school and can get a WIFI hotspot for home from the school if they don't have internet access at home. The school district's plan is to get enough computers so that each class has a set of computers that students can use at school and each student has a computer to keep at home. Students are required to use the Chromebook even if they have another computers. The use of Chromebooks means that student work and submission of student work will need to be done online, which GitHub and many cloud-based IDEs should accommodate.

The main constraint is time. With periods being only 30 minutes long, I expect to have no more than 17 hours per semester for lessons, problets, and labs. But even with limited time, the prospect of building something that they can share via a link may motivate some of my students to use their time efficiently in the class. Based on informal surveys in my classes, I serve a student population that had little exposure to computer science in school.  

## Plan

### Software Specifications

#### Instructor

- TechSmith Camtasia version 2019
- Audacity
- Google Drive
- Microsoft PowerPoint
- Google Slides
- Nearpod
- Google Classroom
- PowerSchool Teacher
- GitHub Education
- GitHub Codespaces (or equivalent cloud-based IDE)
- Google Chrome (or equivalent) browser
- Microsoft Windows 10 OS

#### Students

- Google Chrome OS
- Google Drive
- Google Slides
- Nearpod
- Google Classroom
- PowerSchool
- GitHub Education
- GitHub Codespaces (or equivalent cloud-based IDE)

### Hardware Specifications

#### Instructor laptop

Dell Inspiron 3000

Intel 2-Core i3-8130U CPU @ 2.20GHz

8 GB of RAM

1000 GB of storage

#### Student Chromebook

All students will have Chromebooks. Although not all of the students have the same Chromebook, most have the following model:

Dell Chromebook 3100 Education

Intel Celeron 2-Core N4020 CPU @ 2.8GHz

4 GB of RAM

16 GB of storage

11.6" HD (1366 x 768) display

##### In-Class Internet Access

Teachers and students have wireless internet access in the classroom delivered by a Cisco Aironet 2702i controller-based wireless access point.

Results of a recent speed test were as follows:
- 40.2 Mbps download
- 9.98 Mbps upload
- Latency: 2ms

The in-class internet connection is fast and should be able to handle a class set of computers streaming video at the same time.

#### Projector and Speakers

I will be using a HD Canon projector in the classroom to project instruction/directions. Audio will be delievered via a set of Logitech speakers connected to my computer.

### Application

##### TechSmith Camtasia version 2019, Audacity, and Google Drive

For producing lessons on video, I plan on using Camtasia for screen capture and video editing. I plan on using Audacity for editing audio. I already have these software applications installed on my computer and have used them in the past to produce instructional videos.

Lesson videos will be uploaded onto Google Drive, which the school district has adopted and all students have access to using their school Google accounts.

Lessons will be produced with the multimedia principles in mind such as as the coherence principle, pre-training principle, and the segmentation principle. I will be the one narrating in the videos to provide both the visual and auditory elements (per the Dual-Coding Theory and voice principle). 

##### Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides, and Nearpod

For producing lesson slides, I plan on using Microsoft PowerPoint, which has a feature that allows the user to write directly on the slide and replay the writing at a constant, more reader-friendly pace. When I use this feature, I will convert the slides into a video, then add audio. This feature will help me to apply the signaling principle and spatial contiguity principle in my videos.

When I want to share the lesson slides with students, I will be using Google Slides. The school district has adopted the Google suite of cloud-based applications such as Docs, Sheets, and Slides.

When appropriate, I will be uploading the presentation on to Nearpod, which allows the addition of activities that I can use as checks for understanding. All of my students have access to Nearopd using their school Google accounts and have experience using it after a year of distance learning.  

Lesson videos will be embedded in the presentation to keep all relevant content accessible via one link.

#### Google Classroom and PowerSchool Teacher

I will be assigning lessons on Google classroom. I will also provide feedback, such as scores on submitted work, on Google classroom. Students may also comment on each others' web pages on Google classroom if I post each student's webpage link as a separate Google classroom material post. 

I use PowerSchool Teacher for keeping grade and attendance records. Students and their guardians already have access to PowerSchool.

#### GitHub Education and GitHub Codespaces (or equivalent)

I will be sharing a template for the final deliverable on GitHub classroom. I will sync my GitHub classroom to my Google classroom. I will keep track of my students' progress by checking their published webpaged on GitHub.

Each lesson will include at least one problet projected in the classroom, but also viewable on the Nearpod lesson. Students can use a cloud-based IDE to check the results of their HTML, CSS, and/or Javascript response to the problet. Nearpod can be used to gather individual responses, which can then lead to small group and class discussions. Which can then lead to clarification per the peer instruction general practice. I will then give students time to add an element incorporating what they learned in the lesson to their final deliverable (semester project): their webpage published on GitHub. 

I plan on using GitHub Codespaces (or other cloud-based equivalent IDE if GitHub Codespaces is not free for students) for demonstrations in the classroom and in my lesson videos. 

#### Google Chrome (or equivalent) browser

I will need a browser to access some of the online software referenced above.

#### Microsoft Windows 10 OS

I have some of the software referenced above installed on a PC running Microsoft Windows 10. These software choices were made based on the OS on my laptop.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
